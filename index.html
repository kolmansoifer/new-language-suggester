    <h3>Welcome to Programming!</h3>
    <p>The choice to embark on a new challenge like programming can be daunting and intimidating.  <strong>Many</strong> factors will go into how your journey unfolds.  One of those factors is choosing which languages to learn first.  This can be a difficult decision, due in large part to the variety and choices that exist.</p>
      <p>Some languages you may have heard of include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Hoon</li>
        <li>Rust</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li>Go</li>
        </ul>
  <div>
    <p>Regardless of which languages you choose to focus on, learning any of the above will help you on your journey.  In the intereset of helping new entrants navigate this process, i've developed a simple five question survey that can help you determine which path to start down.</p>
